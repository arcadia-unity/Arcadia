(defmacro ^:doc/no-syntax
  defrole
  "`(defrole name entry*)`

Macro for defining roles quickly.
Each entry can be either a key-value pair with a keyword key, such as would normally occur
  in a map intended as an Arcadia role, or an inlined function definition.

Normal key-value pairs get inserted into the generated map. For example,

```clj
(defrole movement
  :state {:speed 3}
  :update #'movement-update)
```

will expand into

```clj
(def movement
  {:state {:speed 3}
   :update #'movement-update})
```

Inlined function definitions have the following syntax:

`(name [args*] body)`

name must be the symbol form of an Arcadia hook keyword. A function
  intended for the `:update` hook, for example, should have the name
  `update`:

```clj
(defrole movement
  :state {:speed 3}
  (update [obj k] ...))
```

Each inlined function definition will *generate a var*, with a name
  constructed as follows: `<name of role>-<name of hook>`

For example, the `movement` role above will generate a var named
  `movement-update` bound to a function with the provided arguments
  and body, and include that var in the generated role map, expanding
  into something like:

```clj
(do
  (defn movement-update [obj k] ...)
  (def movement
    {:state {:speed 3}
     :update #'movement-update}))
```

Note that generating vars is usually a bad idea because it messes with
  tooling and legibility. This macro does it anyway because the hook
  functions should serialize in the Unity scene graph, and that requires
  vars."

(defmacro ^:doc/no-syntax
  defmutable
  "`(defmutable [name [fields*] other*])`

  Defines a new serializable, type-hinted, mutable datatype, intended
  for particularly performance or allocation sensitive operations on a
  single thread (such as Unity's main game thread). These datatypes
  support snapshotting to persistent data via `snapshot`, and
  reconstruction from snapshots via `mutable`; snapshotting and
  reconstructing are also integrated into `state`, `state+`,
  `update-state`, `role`, `role+`, and `roles`.

  `defmutable` instances may be mutated in two ways. Their fields may
  be mutated directly using `set!` and dot syntax. Fields may also be
  dynamically set using `(mut! obj k v)`. Here, `obj` is the
  `defmutable` instance, `k` is the keyword key for an entry, and `v`
  is the new value of that entry to set on the defmutable instance.

  Instances of these types may be converted into persistent
  representations and back via `snapshot` and `mutable`. This
  roundtrips, so if `x` is such an instance:

  ```clj
  (= (snapshot x) (snapshot (mutable (snapshot x))))
  ```

  If a persistent snapshot is specified as the state argument of
  `set-state`, or as the `:state` value in the map argument of
  `role+`, the `ArcadiaState` component will be populated at the
  appropriate key by the result of calling `mutable` on that
  snapshot. Conversely, `role` and `roles` will automatically convert
  any mutable instances that would otherwise be the values of `:state`
  in the returned map(s) to persistent snapshots.

  `defmutable` supports four special options to help define custom
  `snapshot` and `mutable` implementations:

  - `:snapshot`
  - `:mutable`
  - `:snapshot-elements`
  - `:mutable-elements`

  `:snapshot` and `:mutable` expect their values to be in the
  following form:

  `([this-param key-param value-param] body*)`

  When calling `snapshot` or `mutable`, the function defined by
  `:snapshot` or `:mutable` will be called on each entry in the
  `defmutable` instance (in the case of `snapshot`) or the persistent
  map representation (in the case of `mutable`). When these functions
  run, `this-param` will be assigned to the original `defmutable`
  instance for `snapshot`, or to the original persistent map
  representation for `mutable`; `key-param` will be assigned to the
  keyword key of this entry; and `val-param` will be assigned to its
  incoming value. For `:snapshot`, the return will be the value of the
  corresponding entry in the persistent map representation. For
  `:mutable`, the return will be the value of the corresponding entry
  in the `defmutable` instance representation. `:snapshot` and
  `:mutable` should invert each other.

  `:snapshot-elements` and `:mutable-elements` support finer
  specialization of `snapshot` and `mutable` behavior. They expect
  their values to be maps from keyword names of possible entries, to
  the same sort of function specifications taken by `:snapshot` and
  `:mutable`.  Specifications made with `:snapshot-elements` or
  `:mutable-elements` take priority over those made with `:snapshot`
  or `:mutable`.

  See the online documentation for examples.

  `defmutable` will automatically generate a constructor function. As
  with `deftype`, the name of its var will be `->` followed by the
  name of the type, and its expected arguments will be the initial
  values of `fields`, in order.

  For example, given the following `defmutable` definition:

  ```clj
  (defmutable Sheep [wooliness bouyancy])
  ```

  an instance of `Sheep` could be constructed using

  ```clj
  (->Sheep 3 4)
  ```
  
  `defmutable` serialization, via either `snapshot` or Unity
  scene-graph serialization, does *not* currently preserve reference
  identity. Calling `mutable` on the same snapshot twice will result
  in two distinct instances. It is therefore important to store any
  given `defmutable` instance in just one place in the scene graph.

  Since they define new types, reevaluating `defmutable` forms will
  require also reevaluating all forms that refer to them via type
  hints (otherwise they'll fall back to dynamic
  lookups). `defmutable-once` is like `defmutable`, but will not
  redefine the type if it has already been defined (similar to
  `defonce`).

  As low-level, potentially non-boxing constructs, instances of
  `defmutable` types work particularly well with the `magic` library."
