 ;; changes in configuration.edn without a restart
 :reactive true

 ;; You can add custom load paths, for more control over your source

 ;; set to :allow to silently allow non-serializable hooks

 ;; Partially controls the socket-repl.
 ;;
 ;; Value means:
 ;;
 ;; `true`: make default socket-repl (localhost, port 5555)
 ;; `false`: stop ALL socket repls
 ;; a map: opts for `arcadia.internal.socket-repl/server-socket`. Means at
 ;; least the specified server is running.
 ;;
 ;; In the future, a non-map collection of maps (eg, a sequence of
 ;; maps) should specify several servers that should at least be
 ;; running. `true` as element should be default socket-repl.
 ;;
 ;; Only `false` stops servers; `nil` is ignored (means _at least_ no
 ;; servers are running).

 ;; This boolean variable controls whether auto-completion support on an nrepl
 ;; connection is enabled. When enabled, the nREPL server will answer requests
 ;; to the "complete" message with the following information:
 ;;
 ;; - Autocomplete fns in current namespace: The server tries to complete all
 ;;   the symbols available to the current context. That is, the public vars of
 ;;   the current namespace, as well as any `use` or `:refer :all` imported symbols.
 ;; - Autocomplete fns from other namespaces: You can also autocomplete things
 ;;   from other namespaces, both via alias, e.g. `str/split`, and fully
 ;;   qualified name, e.g. `clojure.string/split`.
 ;; - Autocomplete namespaces: The name of namespaces is also autocompleted.
 ;; - Autocomplete keywords: Any keywords used (i.e., interned) in the project
 ;;   are also autocompleted.
