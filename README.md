Arcadia
=======
The integration of the Clojure Programming Language with the Unity 3D game engine.

Status
------
Arcadia is alpha-quality software, and shouldn't be used for anything important yet.

Usage
-----
The contents of the repository should be copied to a folder named `Arcadia` in any Unity project's Assets folder to enable Clojure. In the future, this will be available from the Asset Store. Once copied, you have access to the REPL and the Clojure compiler.

There's a screencast on getting set up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLq9b9lDmkc).

#### Download Zip File

1. Create a subfolder of your Assets folder named Arcadia
2. [Download](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/archive/develop.zip) our zip file and extract its contents into Arcadia

#### Git Clone

```
cd path/to/unity/project/Assets
git clone https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia.git
```

### Prerequisites
Before doing anything, Arcadia requires that Unity be set to run in the background and use the full .NET API

#### Run in Background
Click `Edit > Project Settings > Player`, then in the Inspector under Resolution and Presentation make sure Run In Background is checked.

#### .NET API
Click `Edit > Project Settings > Player`, then in the Inspector under Other Settings make sure Api Compatibility Level is set to .NET 2.0 and not .NET 2.0 Subset.

### REPL
Arcadia ships with a simple networked REPL that is started automatically or from `Clojure > REPL > Start`. You can connect to this REPL using `Clojure/Editor/repl-client.rb`. This script is also the basis of our [Sublime Text support (via SublimeREPL)](https://github.com/clojure-unity/repl-sublimetext), our [Vim support (via vimshell)](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/wiki/Editor-support#vim) and [our Emacs support (via Inferior Lisp)](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/arcadia/wiki/Editor-support#emacs).

### Clojure Components
You can write components in pure Clojure using our [`defcomponent`](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/arcadia/wiki/arcadia.core#defcomponent) form. To be recognized by Unity these must be saved in Clojure files, not just defined in the REPL.

Mailing List
------------
The mailing list is [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arcadia-unity).

IRC
---
The IRC channel for Arcadia is #arcadiaunity on freenode, if we're online we're usually on the channel.

Name
-----
This project was originally named "clojure-unity", but was changed to "Arcadia" to avoid infinging on Clojure's trademarks. It was suggested to us by @ztellman at a bar during StrangeLoop 2014, and we are eternally grateful.
